Mia
As a high elf, Mia learned swordsmanship based on powerful magic.
Although I am usually careless, I will become very serious when fighting.
In Avalon, she worked hard to guard the forest as a younger commander.
Seeing Aidan and his group of people who looked like a jealous person, they thought it was a monster who attacked them, but soon they learned that Aidan was the guide.
After that,
He developed a strong interest in Aidan.
