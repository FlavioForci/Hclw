Morgaz
There are 5 witches in Britania.
In addition to the three mysterious witches, the abyss witch Scyn, who is well known to the people,
And...The Red Lotus Witch Murgaz
The legend of the 5 Great Witches has been widely circulated throughout the continent and is an existence that scares people on the mainland.
If the children cried non-stop at the village, parents would whisper the names of the five witches to scare the children.
Their existence is deeply engraved in people's hearts.
But now, Molgaz, one of the five great witches, is being escorted to the Goblin lair by being tied to a carriage.
She was tied naked, shivering with shame.
I am afraid of what fate I will face.
"What are you...
Molgaz asked in a trembling voice.
The Goblins said with a greedy smile.
"I want you to give birth to little goblin for us!"
Suddenly, the carriage was hit hard and broke up
Aidan and Elizabeth rushed over and defeated the goblins and rescued Molgaz.
"Are you okay? Don't be afraid, it's safe now.
Aidan said.
Molgaz said with tears in his eyes.
"Thank you...thank you..."
Suddenly, she began to talk to herself.
"Hmm...? Shouldn't save me...
Elizabeth asked in shock.
"Huh? What are you saying? Is anyone talking to you?"
Molgaz was startled when he heard what Hat Jun said and said hesitantly.
"Qi, Qi, actually...hat, Hat, Hun...want to make me deliberately be captured...and then burn all the goblin lairs..."
Aidan and Elizabeth were shocked.
"What?"
Molgaz seems to have become accustomed to Hats' plans.
He said in his clothes slowly
"I, I'm fine...I'm used to it...I just didn't expect Hat Jun's plan to be... like this..."
Aidan looked at Molgaz like this and didn't know what to say.
Molgaz seemed to have been used to it for a long time and wore clothes silently.
But she obviously hadn't gotten rid of the fear just now, and her petite body looked pitiful and helpless.
Aidan and Elizabeth had a confused mind and didn't know how to help her.
