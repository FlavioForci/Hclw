Isabel
Duke of the Principality of Aurelia.
Aurelia is a continental country at the southern end of Britania, and has frequent territorial disputes with the Igrit Empire.
It is not surprising that even if the territory of Aurelia was annexed by the Igrit Empire, it is not surprising that it was not annexed.
It is because Aurelia has magic weapons left by the legendary warriors.
The warrior was a person who traveled from the real world in the past. The Principality of Aurelia merged the gun left by the warrior with magic.
Finally, the current magic weapon was produced.
Because of this kind of technical strength, Aurelia was able to confront the Igrit Empire and form a balance.
But as the time for the emperor of the Igrit Empire to hand over power to Prince Lucius, the relationship between the two countries became increasingly greater
Unstable.
