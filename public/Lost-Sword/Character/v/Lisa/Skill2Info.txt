story
"In the dim alley, the gangsters began to harass the roadside stalls again. Lisa watched from a distance and walked slowly to them.
"Let you go through the day, I forgot so soon, right?" Her tone was calm, but her eyes were shining coldly.

"Ha, it's really...it's all covered in blood."
"These meat pieces that can't even sort garbage..."
