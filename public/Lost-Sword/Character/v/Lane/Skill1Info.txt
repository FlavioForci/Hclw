Lane
Lann is known as the witch of the Eastern Empire and is a mixed race between humans and elves.
She has always been fascinated by the legend of the ancient Elgrad Kingdom. After finally buying the Elgrad swordsmanship log, she began to follow the log
Practice sword skills. However, even after reading the swordsmanship log for a long time, I didnâ€™t get much.
"Is it because I don't have enough understanding?"
She wanted to be the swordsman-like person who helped her country a long time ago, and she practiced hard for 100 years. Although everyone was shocked
Sighing at her superb swordsmanship, she was unable to complete the last move that only the sword saint could do.
In this way, she numbed herself with alcohol and was decadent for a long time...
One day, Lane came to the fierce battle of Britania. There, she rescued a dying girl from the soldiers.
It was the girl who gave her a tip about the last move that Lanen finally reached the realm of the Sword Saint.
Lane, who got his wish, entrusted the girl Ruya to the Kingdom of Cornwall and headed to Avalon.
