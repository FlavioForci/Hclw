Katerlin
Katerin's mother, Haida, died of dysfunction when she gave birth to Katerin.
King Brindisal wanted to go with her because of the pain of losing his wife, but he had to force himself to cheer up.
Because he found out that his daughter Katerin was different from other children since she was born.
The autistic daughter is always filled with a cold atmosphere. For this reason, Brindisal was afraid that she would freeze her, so she ordered her to be clothed around her daughter.
Set up a stove.
Until one day, a maid who was taking care of her daughter was frozen to death. The king thought that his daughter must have been cursed, so he summoned Britta.
Merlin, the sage of Nya, helped her see. Merlin then informed him of the amazing fact that Caterin was under the protection of Ice Dragon Ethel
"Merlin...you mean my daughter...she is she under shelter, right? Are you sure that's not a curse!!"
"Haha, please believe me. When she grows up, she should be able to become good friends with Elizabeth. Because that child was also from the Red Dragon.
shelter. ‘
Merlin's words finally made the king feel relieved, and from then on he took great care of his only daughter.
Until Katerin was 13 years old, the news that Britania's concubine son, known as the Black Lion, launched a coup and caused a sensation throughout the continent.
Soon after, news of King Yuser's defeat came, and the situation in Ethel also deteriorated sharply.
Brindisal was not good at fighting, and he always had to maintain his regime by relying on his friendship with King Yuser.
Futigen has always disliked this close friend of King Yuser.
And Loanna, the goddess of the Tiamat religion, and the princess of Futigen, guessed his thoughts.
"Oh, my dear, are you still worried about Ethel in the North? They are just losers who have been driven to the barren lands.
Just leave it to me with confidence.
The Tiamat sent an envoy, and Jon Stefansson, the brother of Brindishar, launched another coup.
Jon, who found a new backer, gathered his own forces and successfully assassinated Brindisal.
Before his death, Brindisal begged him to let his daughter go, but Jon still walked towards Katerlin.
He was so excited that he could sit on the throne and become a member of the new empire of Futigen.
Until Caterin's hand touched his sword.
"The end of this sword. It's cold and sharp. Although I didn't touch it. But I felt it was touched. What do you think?
His sword instantly freezes, followed by his arms and then his neck.
"Car...Catlin...I was wrong...I was wrong..."
Peng!
It was the sound of Jon's frozen neck exploding. That night, Ethel was covered with blood-stained ice sculptures.
That day, Ethel's Ice Queen was born.
