Merlin
Merlin has lived for quite a long time after experiencing the Battle of Dragons.
But compared with those kings who have long become the dust of history, King Yuser is special to her.
King Yuser advocates the Knight's way of treating equally regardless of race or identity.
This made Merlin, who had been discriminated against as a half-human and half-demon, develop a strong interest in him.
Therefore, Merlin assisted Yuser with unyielding help.
Finally, in the Battle of Salisbury Plains where the Red Dragon participated, Yuser won.
It was a historic moment when the Kingdom of Britania was founded.
Merlin, as a mage and a strategist, made an indelible contribution to that victory.
One day, while Merlin was performing astrology, he saw a meteor falling.
“Yuser’s stars fell.
Many kings in history ignored Merlin's advice and even got furious, but they could not escape the end of death.
But King Yuser is different.
"Merlin, since it was you who said it, my death should be not far away. But I still want to do something for my people.
When King Yuser learned of his death, the first thing he thought of was his country, and Merlin decided to do his best to help the great king.
As Merlin predicted, the Kingdom of Britania did not last long.
The coup of Futigen killed many people, and King Yuser died in the final battle of Manchester.
Merlin didn't expect that Futigen's army would be so powerful.
Although he had no choice but to retreat, he did not have any hope.
Because the stars of Elizabeth in the night sky are still shining.
Merlin locked himself in the laboratory.
Her mental state is getting worse and weak, and she hasn't been disappointed with her limit for a long time.
During this period, Futigen had occupied the entire territory of Britania and established an empire.
At this moment, Meilin finally found the way out for the Sword of Kings.
Meilin, who has lived for a long time, has certainly heard of that sword.
That is a sword that only a real king can find.
Even if you find it, if you are not the chosen one, you will not be able to use it and disappear.
But one thing is clear, it is an elf sword.
Merlin felt that the answer could be found in Avalon, so she went to find Avalon's owner Vivian.
Vivian provided detailed information when facing the question from his teacher Merlin
The Holy Sword is a sword with its own will and cannot be obtained just by wanting it.
But Vivian said that as long as the ancient guides can successfully arrive, the location of the holy sword can be found.
Merlin successfully casts magic based on the ancient logs provided by Vivian.
Finally, the legendary guide came to this world.
However, the guide's mental state seemed to be unnatural, and he seemed to know nothing about the world.
I kept saying that I wanted to go home, like an ignorant child.
"Do you want to go home? Then find that sword.
Meilin thought that since he was summoned to find the sword, he could go back as long as he found the sword.
The guide gradually adapted to this world, but unexpectedly he also knew a lot of useful knowledge.
"It's almost done, and it won't be so easy to die anywhere now.
"Huh... Can I set out now?
"However, the name Yuxuan is really strange. Do you want to change the name?"
"...Okay, then call it Aidan, this is the nickname I often use in the game."
“Although I don’t know what you’re talking about…well, Aidan, then please.
Although Merlin was smiling calmly, she thought that the future would depend on the guide in front of her.
Her heart was filled with expectation and anxiety, as well as indescribable excitement.
