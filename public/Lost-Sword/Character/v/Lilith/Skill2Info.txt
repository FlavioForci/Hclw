Lilith
‘Welcome to ~ This is Happy Hotel.
“It’s the White Whale Hotel!
Aidan is very dissatisfied with the succubus who has been helping in the hotel recently.
At first he thought he had just saved a beautiful woman from the troll.
I didn't expect that this succubus could absorb human essence through hugs...
"Come on, guest, please sit down~ Let me recite a spell that will make you delicious! Maya Maya Q!
Every time I saw Lilith dancing a vulgar dance, shuttled between the guests, sucking their essence without realizing it,
It reminds people of the sophisticated insurance marketers in the real world.
Lilith is undoubtedly a great beauty, but in Aidan's view, she is more like a big mosquito.
However, since the recruitment of Lilith, the hotel's income has increased significantly, so Aidan can only turn a blind eye.
This crazy succubus is said to have come to the human world because he likes humans too much.
"Do you... do you know that the way you like humans will kill humans?"
"Hehe, I'm not stupid, that little bit of energy can't kill anyone."
"If you don't believe it, do you want to confirm it yourself tonight?"
Lilith's charming eyes made Aidan's face flush and she hurriedly got up and left.
"No, no! I don't want to know?!"
Since Lilith came, Aidan has had the habit of always confirming whether the door was locked.
"Aidan is really... People come to help for free, can't you be kind to her?
Elizabeth scolded Aidan.
"So, your focus is 'free'..."
Seeing Bediville wearing bunny girl's clothes,
I felt that Lilith was just wearing strange clothes.
This perverted succubus should be able to help too...
Aidan can only comfort himself like this.
