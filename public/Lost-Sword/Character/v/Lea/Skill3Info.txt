Lea
Lea was sorting out her books in the hotel lobby as usual.
She saw the numbers on the books through her glasses, and a strange smile appeared on her face.
At this time, Elizabeth and Bedeville walked in.
Lea looked up at them and said coldly.
"Why did you come? Do you know how long you were late?
Elizabeth was so scared that she stood at the door and dared not come in.
"Sorry, sorry, store manager...we met villagers in need on the way..."
Bedivir also explained nervously.
"I'm really sorry, the store manager. We will definitely pay attention in the future, Ming..."
Lea nodded unmovedly.
‘I don’t want to hear these excuses. Miss Elizabeth? Please clean the kitchen tonight, this is the punishment for being late today.
"yes..."
Seeing Elizabeth drooping, Lea approached her and whispered.
"I will prepare warm tea for you after you finish cleaning the kitchen. Then have a cup of tea and take a break.
Elizabeth showed a surprised expression when she heard it, but quickly lowered her head to express her gratitude.
"Thank you, store manager!"
Leah then told Bediville.
"Please treat Miss Bediville seriously at the bar and keep it open until it closes."
"Well, what?"
“If you have any dissatisfaction, you can raise it now.
"No, no! I'll go now, store manager!
Lea thought for a while and whispered to Bediville.
"We will be standing at the bar for a long time. Remember to drink more water when you have time. We must put health first."
"Woooo...Thank you, store manager!
Seeing this scene, Aidan felt that although Leah seemed very strict, she was actually a person who knew how to care about other people's soft hearts.
Just by looking at Leah's attitude, you can tell that she did not treat them as part-time employees, but treated them sincerely as companions.
"If it weren't for Leah, then the two wouldn't have a chance to be a new person."
While Aidan was touching himself and talking to himself...
"Ha, do you want to teach you how to be a new person?"
"Ah? No, I don't need it! I'll go up and see if that guy Morgana is lazy again!
Almost hit Leah's stalwart and sweet Gazel.
