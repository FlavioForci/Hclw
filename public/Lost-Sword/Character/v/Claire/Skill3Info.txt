Claire
Claire, a girl born in a poor civilian family, is slowly dying.
She was born with bad luck and was a man born cursed.
But Claire is lucky.
Because little Esmeralda came to their village at the right time.
Esmeralda heals Claire, allowing her to last her life.
But Claire's doom is not over, and his stable life has not lasted for how long.
The Goblin Elder attacked their village and launched an inhumane massacre. My father died under the sword of the Goblin.
My mother died unfortunately while resisting the Goblins' invasion.
At that moment, Claire's power was awakened.
Her black flames burned the village and all the monsters.
Zion: "This time it's successful."
Iscario: "No, the attack without distinguishing between enemies and me can only mean that it is a failure.
Her curse has been accompanied by her from birth
That curse is actually related to the sect of Tiamat.
Claire is the human experimental subject selected by the Tiamattes after sneaking into the Kingdom of Britania.
Claire: “My life is really unfortunate.
The Tiamat Church left behind the failed works, leaving only Claire who was waiting for death with all his might.
On the line of life and death, an existence shrouded in dazzling light fell from the sky.
She looked at the light, and the dazzling light took away her eyesight but saved her life.
Claire became a nun with questions about the light.
Later, through Gatuli's information, she learned that she was actually an experimental subject of the Tiamatism, and the villagers also died at the hands of the Tiamatism.
From then on, she embarked on the path of fighting nuns.
In fact, the experiment of Tiamat was not completely failed.
Her physical abilities have completely exceeded human limits.
"The pagans were found in the Earl's Territory of Carmason."
The Bishop of Canterbury read the report for her with concern.
“Okay, I’ll deal with it.
Claire ran away with his staff tightened.
To avenge the sect of Tiamat.
