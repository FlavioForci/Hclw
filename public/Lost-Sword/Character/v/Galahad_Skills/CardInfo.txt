story
Sunny weather.
The four-leaf clover found in the field was handed over to Galahad.
Come on, Galahad, will bring you good luck.
"Wow, brother. Thank you so much for giving me such an expensive gift!"
(â€¦The first time I saw that weeding was given as a gift. What is this, is it kidding?)
Galahad said carefully, putting the four-leaf clover in his arms.
"I will treasure my brother's gift."
(Haah, it's so Sense...)
Looking at Galahad's radiance, I felt happy.
