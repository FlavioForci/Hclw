Lucy
"Living...Lucy..."
When her mother's bleeding hands fell, Lucy's heart died.
Lucy's tribe was massacred by General Hobbes, who was famous for his cruelty and injustice.
Only Lucy survived.
My parents who had dinner with her yesterday...the friends I wanted with and the peaceful village no longer exists.
Lucy walked to the edge of the cliff while walking on the ground. When she was about to leap, she noticed the red hairpin in her hand.
Because I used too much force to tighten my hairpin, my palms were covered in blood.
That was the hairpin my mother gave her at the last moment of her life.
My mother was worried that Lucy would be afraid, and she did not forget to smile at her before she died.
Looking at the hairpin reminded her of her mother's face.
I can't just die like this.
Lucy immediately turned around and left the cliff.
After that, Lucy did nothing to survive.
From being a slave to a coolie to the lowest prostitution den, she has done everything.
One day, she finally ushered in her prostitution den.
General Britania Hobbs, who killed her parents.
He lived a debauch like other generals who were demoted to the border.
As usual, he wanted to spend the night with the blonde barbarians, and suddenly felt a stinging pain in his left chest.
"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Hobbs pushed away the naked Lucy and rolled in pain on the ground.
Lucy rushed over and pushed the sword inserted into Hobbes' heart again.
"Mom suffered the same pain as you are now, right? No, she must have suffered more pain than you."
"Cough uh...uh..."
"Hahaha, I succeeded. I feel relieved when I see my enemy die in pain."
Lucy left Hobbes, who was no longer moving, and walked out of the prostitution nest.
Hobbs' men should come here soon, but Lucy felt extremely relaxed.
Is it because of revenge on your parents?
Or is it because of my humble and painful life that is about to come to an end?
Lucy herself didn't know it either.
She just kept laughing.
When she came out, it was not Hobbs's men who were greeted.
It is a bunch of houses killed by Hengers, the patriarch of Titania.
"Is it her?
Hengus asked with a frown as he looked at Lucy's blood-stained naked body.
"Haha, yes, it's the breath I feel. It's her.
"Child, don't you think it's over to kill a shameful leopard, right? The real enemy is there.
Lucy looked at Loanna intently and suddenly laughed wildly.
She didn't know what she was laughing at.
Maybe she can continue to avenge her family and make her feel so happy.
