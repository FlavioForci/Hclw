Morgana
Among the many elves, she is the most special one.
After dying, she will be reincarnated and reborn. She is the only spirit with the power of the Dark God
Thanks to this, Morgana lived for a long time and achieved many legendary achievements, and finally won the title of Elf King.
Morgana was once a legendary figure leading the elf era. But with constant reincarnation, her mind began to have problems.
She began to lose her memory and sense of self, and was accompanied by severe autism, and she could no longer communicate with the outside world normally.
Slowly she was forgotten by the elves and eventually became a symbolic existence.
When she had experienced countless reincarnations and barely saved her mind,
Her character has been completely distorted and has become extremely weird.
Today, she has become a hibernator who is impatient with anything.
Reincarnation is really a troublesome thing.
Because I have to give up my original beautiful face, fleshy lips, sexy figure, and endless spiritual power, and I can turn back to nothing.
A little brat.
She lay naturally on the bed as usual, closing her eyes for another reincarnation.
Little Morgana woke up and touched her breasts. Sure enough, the once majestic double peaks disappeared again. But soon she felt it
The air in Avalon is different from before.
Many of the ancient elves she relied on had stopped breathing.
This reincarnation is indeed very wrong.
Only Vivian survived to welcome Morgana's reincarnation.
"You're awake, Lord Morgana. A lot has happened during this time."
The almost immortal ancient elves died in an instant, which greatly impacted Morgana.
But her feelings were already numb and she couldn't even raise her spirit to mourn them.
All life in the world will eventually die.
Morgana understands this more than anyone else.
As usual, she was reluctant to live in Avalon with the help of Vivian. One day, my friend Merlin wrote to her.
“The death of your friends has something to do with the Church of Tiamat.
"And, I have an interesting errand here. Do you want to give it a try?"
Merlin's errand never disappointed her.
For her boring daily routine, it was a conditioner. No, it should be said that it is a good medicine that can help her endure the curse of immortality.
Morgana went to Merlin's house with a little anticipation, where she met a man from another world.
Morgana, who has always regarded humans and pigs as equals, was disappointed. But soon she changed her mind.
I didn’t expect that this human being, who was bullied by me, would be so interesting!
This lowly human being is both stupid and smart, rude and attentive, and is truly an interesting existence full of contradictions.
During the adventure with Aidan, Morgana unknowingly felt the feeling of being alive.
It's like meeting a confidant I haven't seen for a long time...
It's like meeting someone you're thinking about...
Looking at the clear sky, Morgana fell into a brief memory. But soon she shook her head again, trying hard to deny the fact that she had just been immersed in the memories.
"Where has this pig gone again?"
It must be hiding somewhere to take a nap again
At this critical moment when Princess Elizabeth is about to appear...
