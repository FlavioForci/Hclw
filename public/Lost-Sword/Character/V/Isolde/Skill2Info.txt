Isolde
Princess Isolde, supported by the whole nation of Cornwall, is the only descendant of King Mark.
But Isolde chose a completely different path from his father, King Mark.
Compared with King Mark, who advocates high pressure rule, Isolde, who has rich emotions and gentle personality, advocates conquering people with virtue.
So compared with the aristocratic class, she has a higher support rate in the civilian class.
Isolde believed that for the prosperity of the Cornwall Kingdom, people of all races and classes needed to unite. But treat the cats as
The slave nobles were very dissatisfied with this and joined forces to boycott Isolde's intervention in the state. The father King Mark also said to this with the Kingdom of Cornwall

A resistance army that was absolutely loyal to Isolde.
In response, there was news that Princess Isolde was plotting against rebellion in the palace. But King Mark, who knows very well about Isolde, doesn't he think about it
I was interested, and did not take any measures.
Just when the atmosphere in the kingdom is very delicate...
Futigen launched a coup and established his own empire. This puts the entire Cornwall Kingdom in a shadow of anxiety. In the palace
After several consecutive days of meetings, the nobles divided into pro-war factions and surrender factions, and started a fierce debate.
Isolde believes that this crisis will become an opportunity for the kingdom to work together and begin to study with Tristan how to make it happen.
The Kingdom of Cornwall survived the crisis.
