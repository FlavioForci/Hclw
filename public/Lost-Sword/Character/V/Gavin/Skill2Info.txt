Gavin
The sword exists for faith and righteousness.
â€œThis is what my father often says to me.
"The situation has changed now. We are the guardians of the royal family and must not be involved in meaningless political struggles.
If that was what the family wanted, then I put down the sword in my hand.
The girl Gavin was once a talented person who was expected to become the strongest knight of the Pandragon royal family.
If there were no accidents, she would have been the veritable number one sword recognized by the royal family and family.
But things went against my wishes, and Gavin's family became the lackeys of the usurpers of the throne.
Gavin's sword could only point to King Yuser and Princess Elizabeth, who were supposed to be her lord.
She, who is close to Elizabeth, cannot accept this fact.
That night, Gavin broke his sword and prepared to leave the family.
When his sister Gahris saw this scene, she said to her very disappointedly.
"I gave up the sword because of my sister. But my sister wants to put down the sword now? Although I don't understand your mood, times have changed. Think about it carefully.
When she was a child, Gahris wanted to become a knight and worked hard to practice swordsmanship, but after seeing Gavin's unattainable talent, she decided to move towards strategy.
Later, she became a general of the Britannian Empire and made many military achievements.
The increasing achievements of the sister are a great pain and an indelible sin for Gavin.
Gavin was wandering outside for a long time.
Until one day, she met Elizabeth and her group like fate and saved them with a branch.
But for some reason, the strange man known as the guide saw Gavin and his eyes glowed and began to follow her all day.
Three visits to the thatched cottage.
That was a historic moment when Aidan successfully recruited Gavin.
