Guinivia
The beauty of the country.
This idiom appears in everyone who sees Guinivia for the first time.
When Guinivia first stepped into the palace, all the ministers were shocked.
Her fair skin and beautiful face are simply the ideal goddess in their minds.
As Guinivia grew older, the entire continent of Britania knew about this beauty.
News about her even crossed the continent of Britania and spread to the Igrit Empire in the south.
Since the coup launched by Futigen, the political situation within Camilliad has become extremely complicated.
If they cannot form an alliance with Britania, it will be difficult to resist Igrit, who has been invaded across the sea.
At this moment, Vivian from Avalon sent an invitation to talk.
"Haha, Father? Do you have any other concerns?"
"...They must have wanted to form an alliance with us and attack Britania and Titania together.

"Do you think it's necessary to participate in this talk?"

"you mean..."
Guinivia seemed to feel a little hot and said, blowing her huge chest.
"Huh~ If you only invest on one side, the risk is too great. Votigen's next goal should be Salisbury and Cornwall. By then
It's not too late for us to make a judgment based on the situation.
Seeing King Leon showing a praising expression, Guinivia continued.
“Let my daughter go to this meeting.
