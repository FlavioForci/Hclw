Enya
"Dear ~? As long as you answer well, you can go back alive."
Baron Griezman remembers that he just had a glass of wine with a sexy maid with purple hair at the banquet.
When he woke up, he found that he was tied to a chair wearing only underwear.
"Where...hello, do you know who I am? Although I don't know who instructed you..."
Pop smell!
"Well!!"
"Roar!!
Griezmann screamed in pain when he saw a dagger in his thigh.
"Dear, I'll give you another 5 seconds. Tell me, where is that token?"
"Well...he...in...in my top pocket..."
Enya walked over with her long legs and began to search for Griezmann's clothes. After a while, she found the token.
"Ah! Found it?"
puff!
"Woolen cloth!"
The short sword that Enya seemed to throw out casually directly made Griezmann's life, and an extremely cold smile appeared on her face.
"Maya, are you very happy? He is the guy who sells you to a pagan.
Enya showed a bitter expression, and she swore again when she left the room.
"I won't let you wait too long, Maya. That's my way of revenge.
