Christina
The young queen of the Kingdom of Mercia, Christina.
Although Mercia is a kingdom, its political system is close to that of a republic with a cabinet.
After the early death of the former king, the young Christina inherited the throne.
The reason why her throne was so stable was that a group of elders who were loyal to the previous kings made an indelible contribution.
As she grew up, Christina began to feel dissatisfied with the elders who overprotected herself.
But the elders did see themselves as granddaughters, and they were very united.
In 522, after the successful coup, Futigen immediately sent the priest Iscario of the Tiamatism to Mercia and proposed to sign a non-aggression treaty.
Anyone can see that it was a strategy to delay time in order to pacify the civil war in Britania, but if it was refused, there was no doubt that Mercia would be the next target.
"Seeing that you have not maintained the proper manners to a great country, I will regard it as you have refused."
When the angry Christina is about to order the execution of Iscario,
John, the Supreme Elder, looked at Christina and shook his head gently, then knelt down to Iscario and said.
“The Kingdom of Mercia is willing to accept the non-aggression treaty.”
Christina clearly knew that this would damage national prestige, but she failed to stop John.
After Iscario returned, Christina felt angry, powerless and self-blame.
"Elder John, am I still the queen of a country like this? What is the difference between this and those miserable vassal states?"
"Her Majesty, we are only separated from them by a border. Although it is cowardly, now the Holy Titania has joined Brita.
The Nian Empire, we are really unable to fight them right now.
"But, it's not hopeless."
John handed the letter from Avalon to Christina.
That was a letter proposing that countries except Britania and Titania hold alliance talks in Avalon.
"Maybe we'll find a way out in the talks. Merlin, the Sage and Vivian, the Elves, should have a way.
Christina said pouting as she touched the red rope that connected from her collarbone to her chest.
"Thank you for kneeling for me. If that's a pointless talk, we'll attack Britania first.
John said with a smile,
“You have grown up.
