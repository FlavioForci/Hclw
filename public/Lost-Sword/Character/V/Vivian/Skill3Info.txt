Vivian
The world of swords and magic, Britania.
To the west of Britania, there is an Elf Island called Avalon.
Vivian is the owner of this Avalon.
Avalon, who attaches importance to world balance, has never interfered with disputes in the human world and maintained neutrality.
But after Futigen launched a coup, Avalon took the initiative to convene the alliance meeting.
This is very unexpected news for the entire continent of Britania.

"Haha, that's not. I just don't want to see Merlin's country perish like this.
Vivian put down the teacup and smiled.
Merlin wanted to see something from her deep eyes, but failed.
"Puff, you're really... but thank you for saying that. Thanks to you, you can gather the countries."
