Jiluke
She fell in love with the young and promising Youss, willingly giving him his own strength.
But Yuser broke his vow to her and married the married woman Iglain.
Betrayed Scy, furious because of jealousy
On the night when King Yuser and Iglain held a grand wedding ceremony, Ssy went to find King Yuser.
‘You broke the oath.
“I’m sorry.!
After slandering Yuser and Iglain the curse that they could not have children, Sercy returned to the forest.
Even though it was a very severe curse, King Yuser, who usually regarded himself as a value for credibility, turned against him because he had first turned against his oath.
There is nothing to do.
He could not punish Scy, but could only bear the pain silently.
The curse contained Scy's overwhelming hatred, which was a very powerful spell, and even Merlin could do nothing about it.
Sercy returned to the cottage in the woods and vowed not to go to the outside world again.
