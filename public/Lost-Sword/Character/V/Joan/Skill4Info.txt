Joan of Armor
"Burn that witch to death!"
That was the last sentence Joan of Arc heard.
He did his best for the country, but the final reward was burned to death as a witch.
This is her miserable ending.
"Hey, it's time to get up. It's already afternoon."
"here it is..."
Joan of Arc woke up rubbing his big eyes and found himself lying in a horse in a village.
"You've been hit by those guys."
The one who saved her was Eunya, who was often wanted for assassination.
Although he saved his life, he was rescued by a murderer who likes to kill.
Then she woke up in the smelly horse... she felt desperate when she thought of this.
"Why did you want to save me? Why would you let me die there..."
"You don't want to know who is a witch who accused you of being a witch?"
"Who is it?"
â€œTiamat teaches.
At that moment, Joan of Arc, known as the witch, decided his next goal.
