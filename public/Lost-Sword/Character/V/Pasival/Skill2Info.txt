Pasival
Aidan and his group were surrounded by the imperial pursuit army and fell into crisis. A large number of enemies held sharp swords and slowly approached them.
"This is a little bit bad." Aidan said to himself.
At this time, a girl appeared. She swung the sword in her hand quickly, knocking down the pursuit army one by one as if she was dancing.
The elf king Morgana said with a warning look: “That girl’s power is very unusual.
The battle situation changed instantly. After all the enemies retreated, the girl adjusted her breathing and turned to look at Aidan.
Aidan leaned over and asked, “Thank you for helping me, what’s your name?
"My name is Pasival, and I am the daughter of a declining family. In order to realize my father's will, I am looking for the Holy Grail." Pasival replied humbly.
After hearing this, Aidan smiled and said, "Are you looking for the Holy Grail? What should I do? The Holy Grail has been found by me.
Pasival was full of surprise and tears. "You really found the Holy Grail? Then what should I do in the future...?"
Aidan put his hand on Pasival's shoulder and said, "I'm really sorry. But I promise you that I will definitely come back and hand you an important task in the future."
Pasival looked at Aidan in tears. "Really? I have always wanted to offer everything I have to serve a lord...
Aidan nodded and smiled tenderly. "Of course. I believe in your loyalty and enthusiasm.
Pasival bowed his knees gratefully. "So, from today on, you will be my lord. I will give you everything I have to follow you.
Aidan helped her up and said. "Thank you, Pasival, but we still have something to do now, so let's look forward to meeting soon.
Aidan and his group left. Pasival looked at their departure backs and made up his mind secretly. She has already made a promise for the new lord
All preparations are given. The encounter with Aidan gave her new hope and goals. In order to fight side by side with Aidan in the future, she decided to make herself a stronger knight.
